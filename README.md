# langchain-zim-generator-pinecone

This python script uses langchain and OpenAI to create an index.html file containing ZIM code.
This version has the embeddings hosted in a vectorestore at Pinecone.

Here is a version using FAISS vectorstory in-memory:

## Demo

Try it live here:

Please note that the use of OpenAI embeddings seems to work with OpenAI Keys from payed plans only.

## How to install for local development:

1. Install Python 3.10 on your machine and use a bash terminal (maybe within Visual Studio Code)
2. Git Clone: `git clone https://github.com/ajerni/langchain-zim-generator.git`
3. Move to the new directory: `cd langchain-zim-generator`
4. Create Virtual Environment: `python -m venv env` or `python3 -m venv env` (on Windows: `python -m venv c:\path\to\env`)
5. Activate Virtual Environment: `source env/bin/activate` on Mac or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows
6. Install Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Create a .env file containing your OpenAI Key: `echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz" > .env` (replace xyz with your own OpenAI Key) - or just enter your API Key when running the app (.env is only used for local development)
8. Run the app: `streamlit run main.py`
9. Fork my repo and start developing until we have the ultimate ZIM-Auto-Pilot ðŸš€

- Dr. Abstract for his amazing ZIM: https://zimjs.com

## To-Dos:

- Prompts need further finetuning (i.e. make positioning work as a next step etc.)
- later on I can think of using langchain agents to include google search for pictures which can be added to the stage etc.
